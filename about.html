<h3>Hello everyone!</h3>
<p>My name is Jorge Ortiz Escribano and I'm a Computer Engineer. In this blog I share some of the most important software projects in which I have been able to work on. My blog is welcoming to new and experienced programmers alike. Hope you enjoy!</p>

<h3>You want to know more?</h3>
<p>I was born in Murcia and right now I'm working for a company in Madrid. I started programming for the first time when I was 11 years old. At that time, I liked to create homemade  software for the PSP video game console (usually called 'homebrew'). From that moment, I became interested in programming and it is still one of the most important activities of my life.</p>

<p>From 2015 to 2019 I was studying the Computer Engineering degree from the University of Murcia. During that time, I was an internal student in the Department of Computer Engineering and Technology (DITEC). In addition, one of my projects was endowed with a Collaboration Grant from the Spanish Ministry of Education and Culture (MEC). I was also doing internships with some companies in the area.</p>

<p>Right now, I have a full-time job for a company in Madrid, where I live with my girlfriend.</p>
