<h3>Hello everyone!</h3>

    I was born in Murcia in 1997. I started programming for the first time when I was only 11 years old.
    At that time, I liked to create homemade software for the PSP video game console (usually called 'homebrew').
    I have already <a href="2018/01/01/Welcome.html">posted about that</a>.
    From that moment, I became interested in programming and it is still one of the most important activities of my life.

    From 2015 to 2019, I was studying the Computer Engineering degree from the University of Murcia.
    During that time, I was an internal student in the Department of Computer Engineering and Technology (DITEC).
    In addition, <a href="2019/06/10/LeNet.html">one of my projects</a> was endowed with a Collaboration Grant from the Spanish Ministry of Education and Culture (MEC).
    I have also done some internships, collaborated with some companies and had a full-time job.
    But my dream is to become a university professor someday...

    In addition to programming, I also like to practice sports, especifically, running.
