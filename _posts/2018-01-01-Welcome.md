# Who I am and what I do

Hello folks, welcome to my blog.
My name is Jorge and I'm a Computer Engineer.
In this blog, I will share some of the most important software projects in which I have worked on.

I started programming for the first time when I was only 11 years old.
At that time, I liked to create homemade software for the PSP video game console (usually called 'homebrew').
I developed tons of mini-applications under the nickname *jorge_97*.

Many of those applications are still available and can be downloaded.
The best known application was probably PSPExplorer.
It was a shell that looked like the operating system Windows XP and included multiple applications like a file explorer, a text and image editor, a calculator, etc.

There are some screenshots below:

I also ported the famous game Donkey Kong (I'm so proud of this one):

I wrote all these applications in Lua and thanks to that, I learnt a lot about programming and got really interested in it.

After some years delving into the different fields of computer engineering, I have realised that I don't have a favourite one. Probably the ones that I like the most are parallel programming, image processing and embedded systems.

I hope you enjoy this blog as much as I do writing it and developing the applications.
Iâ€™d be very grateful if you'd help it spread by sharing to on Twitter, Facebook or wherever.

Thank you so much!

I would like to end this post with a *freak joke* about parallel programming:

> A programmer had a problem, so he decided to use threads.
>
> Now 2 has.he problems

It's happened to all of us at one time or another :D
