# Description

I'm pretty sure that you have seen the banner photo before. If not, she is Sharbat Gula. An Afghan child who was living in a refugee camp. That photo was taken by photojournalist Steve McCurry and it appeared on the June 1985 cover of National Geographic.

The beauty behind this photo is indisputable... but can it hide something else?

The answer is yes, of course. And that's what I'm going to talk now: [steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography).

According to Wikipedia, steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.

As you can see, there are multiple ways to hide information; for example, it is possible hide an image within a soundfile, hide an image within another image, or even, a text within an image.

In this post, we will talk about the last tecnique: hiding a text (or even a whole file) within an image.

## Hiding data within an image

A 24-bit bitmap image uses 8 bits to represent each of the three color values (red, green, and blue) of each pixel. We could use the least significant bit of each color byte to store information. And that change is likely to be undetectable by the human eye.

Therefore, every pixel of the image would give us 3 bits to store information. So, using an image with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels (which is a very common resolution, better known as *FullHD*) we would have 2073600 pixels available, which can be translated to a data container of 6220800‬ bits (*≈760 KiB*).

But if we use a 8K image (which has a resolution of 7680x4320 pixels), we would be able to store almost 12 MiB of information. This means we could store a compressed folder or even a whole program.

## JIEnc

JIEnc is the acronynm for ***J**ava **I**mage **Enc**oder*. It's a desktop application developed in Java that takes advantage of the tecnique commented above. It allows you to encode (or hide) a text message or even a whole file withing a PNG image.

JIEnc is very easy to use. In order to encode a message/file, just select an image to use as a container and type a message or choose a file. Click the *Encode* button and if the image is big enough to contain the object, a new image will be generated.

On the other hand, to extract the information encoded in an image file, you just have to choose the image and click on *Decode* button.

*In order to use this application, you need to have JRE (Java Runtime Environment) installed on your computer. You can download it from the [Oracle website](https://www.java.com/en/download/).*
