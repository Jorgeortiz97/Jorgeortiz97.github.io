# Description

Have you always wanted to know what it feels like to control a spaceship?

With this application you will make it. Okay... no, but you will be close.

SpaceWar is a classic space game. You control a spaceship and you must avoid colliding with asteroids, either by dodging or destroying them. The peculiarity of SpaceWar is that the ship is not controlled by keyboard or with a common joystick, but is controlled by an accelerometer. In my case, I used the accelerometer that comes included in the low-cost development board [FRDM-KL25Z](https://es.farnell.com/nxp/frdm-kl25z/arm-kinetis-kl25z-freedom-dev/dp/2191861).

Here you can see a video of the game using the board as a *joystick*:

# How does it work?

The development board includes a 3-axis accelerometer and a touchpad.
An accelerometer is a device that can measure the acceleration on the three axis, we can use this information to determine the object's position in space and monitor the object's movement.

Data is sent from the development board to the computer trough a serial connection.
The development board act as a DAQ (*data acquisition*) device.

The algorithm for the development board is quite simple:

```c
// Create serial connection
Serial pc(USBTX, USBRX);
float threshold = 0.3;
...
// Every 0.01 seconds, we send information related to the accelerometer and the touch pad:
while (true) {
    float x, y, z, but;
    x = acc.getAccX();
    y = acc.getAccY();
    z = acc.getAccZ();
    but = tsi.readPercentage();
    
    if (y > threshold || y < -threshold)
        pc.printf("X%f\n", y);
    if (x > threshold || x < -threshold)
        pc.printf("Y%f\n", x);
    if (z > threshold || z < -threshold)
        pc.printf("Z%f\n", z);
        
    if (but >= 0.1 && but <= 0.9)
        pc.printf("B0.0\n");
    
    wait(0.01);
}
```

As we can see, the accelerometer data is only sent when values are higher than a certain threshold.
Moreover, the touchpad data is captured and sent to the computer.

The desktop application then receives the data and takes care of the game logic.

## Source code
The board program is written in C (using the [mbed platform](https://os.mbed.com/)) and the desktop application is developed using JavaFX.

If you want to see the code, you can find it in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Jorgeortiz97/SpaceWar).
