# Description

I have always wondered how emulators work. When I was a child I used to spend many hours playing with two famous emulators: VBA (Visual Boy Advance) and NeoRAGEx. The former was an emulator for the GameBoy Advance videoconsole and the later, for the NeoGeo.

Some weeks ago I found a very [interesting tutorial to develop your own CHIP-8 emulator](http://www.multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/).
CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language. It was not a real system, but more like a virtual machine (VM). Games written in this language could easily run on systems that had a CHIP-8 interpreter.

That tutorial was written in C/C++ and I decided to implement it in Java using the Swing toolkit.

## CEMU8

I followed the tutorial commented above and created my own application: CEMU-8. It is a desktop application written in Java.
I decided to extend the original implementation and add some interesting features:
* Save/load during the game.
* Add sound (in fact, CHIP-8 only needs one sound: a beep tone).
* Screenshots.

*In order to use this application, you need to have JRE (Java Runtime Environment) installed on your computer. You can download it from the [Oracle website](https://www.java.com/en/download/).*

You can download CEMU-8 using the button below:
