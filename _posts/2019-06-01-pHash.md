# Description

The main objective of this work is the implementation of a perceptual hashing algorithm. These functions or algorithms are used in finding cases of online copyright infringement. The aim of this project was to create a useful hashing algorithm for [reverse image search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_image_search). I have been followed the tutorial that appears on the [HackerFactor blog](http://hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php%3F/archives/432-Looks-Like-It.html).

In order to reduce the execution time, the fundamental operation of this algorithm has been designed and synthesized in a FPGA system. This operation is the calculation of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). DCTs are very important to numerous applications in engineering. For example, lossy compression of audio (MP3) and images (JPG). 

## DCT design

Each value of the output vector 'out' is calculated using the following expression:

$$ Out_i = \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} In_j * cos [\frac{\pi}{N}*(j+\frac{1}{2})*i] $$

Besides that, it is necessary to multiply the $$Out_0$$ term by $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$$ and multiply the resulting vector by an overall scale factor of $$\sqrt{\frac{2}{N}}$$.


The code that appears below contains the implementation of the expression:

```c
const float ISQRT2	 = 1.0f / sqrtf(2.0f);
const float SCALE_FACTOR = sqrtf(2.0f / DIM);
const float PI_FACTOR	 = M_PI / DIM;

void dct_1d_sw(float in[DIM], float out[DIM]) {
	
	for (int i = 0; i < DIM; i++) {
		float acc = .0f;

		for (int j = 0; j < DIM; j++)
			acc += in[j] * cosf(i * (j + 0.5f) * PI_FACTOR);

		acc *= SCALE_FACTOR;

		if (i == 0) acc *= ISQRT2;
		out[i] = acc;
	}
}
```

The algorithm designed for the FPGA appears below:


```c
void dct_1d_hw(float in[DIM], float out[DIM]) {

	float out_bram[DIM], coef_bram[DIM];

	#pragma HLS array_partition variable=out_bram complete dim=0
	#pragma HLS array_partition variable=coef_bram complete dim=0

	for (int j = 0; j < DIM; j++) {
		#pragma HLS unroll
		coef_bram[j] = (j + 0.5f) * PI_FACTOR;
		out_bram[j] = .0f;
	}

	for (int j = 0; j < DIM; j++) {
		#pragma HLS pipeline
		float input = in[j];
		for (int i = 0; i < DIM; i++)
			#pragma HLS unroll
			out_bram[i] += input * cosf(i * coef_bram[j]);
	}

	out[0] = out_bram[0] * ISQRT2 * SCALE_FACTOR;
	for (int i = 1; i < DIM; i++)
		#pragma HLS pipeline
		out[i] = out_bram[i] * SCALE_FACTOR;
}
```

That design generates this execution scheme:

In order to achieve an efficient data transference between FPGA and CPU, I have used the following pragmas:

```c
#pragma SDS data mem_attribute(in:PHYSICAL_CONTIGUOUS, out:PHYSICAL_CONTIGUOUS)
#pragma SDS data access_pattern(in:SEQUENTIAL, out:SEQUENTIAL)
#pragma SDS data zero_copy(in, out)
void dct_1d_hw(float in[DIM], float out[DIM]);
``` 


## pHash design

In order to calculate the pHash value, we need to implement the 2-dimension DCT. This is achieved by applying the DCT operation over all the rows and columns of the image. The pHash algorithm appears below:

```c
unsigned long long phash(unsigned char input[3][DIM][DIM], int hw_mode) {

	float grayscale[DIM * DIM], dct2d_output[DIM * DIM];
	unsigned long long hash = 0;

	// STEP 1: Get the grayscale image.
	for (int y = 0; y < DIM; y++)
		for (int x = 0; x < DIM; x++)
			grayscale[y * DIM + x] = (float) 
				(0.2126 * input[RED][y][x]
				+ 0.7152 * input[GREEN][y][x]
				+ 0.0722 * input[BLUE][y][x]);


	// STEP 2: Compute the 2D-DCT.
	dct_2d(grayscale, dct2d_output, hw_mode);


	// STEP 3: Compute the average value of the lowest frecuencies (top-left subarray).
	const int SUB_DIM = DIM / 4;

	float acc = -dct2d_output[0]; // Exclude first value
	for (int y = 0; y < SUB_DIM; y++)
		for (int x = 0; x < SUB_DIM; x++)
			acc += dct2d_output[y * DIM + x];

	float average = (float) (acc / (SUB_DIM * SUB_DIM - 1));

	// STEP 4: Compute the hash using the average value.
	for (int y = 0; y < SUB_DIM; y++)
		for (int x = 0; x < SUB_DIM; x++) {
			unsigned char greater = (dct2d_output[y * DIM + x] > average);
			hash = (hash << 1) | greater;
		}

	return hash;
}
```

## Hardware platform
The designs have been synthesized on a ZedBoard board, which incorporates the *System on a Chip* Zynq-7000. That SoC combines a Dual-core ARM Cortex™-A9 processor with a FPGA and 512 MB of DDR3 RAM. The ARM processor operates at a frequency of 667 MHz. The FPGA is composed of the following resources:

* 280 RAM blocks of 18 Kb (≈ 4.92 MB).
* 220 units DSP_48E.
* 106400 flip-flops.
* 53200 LUTs (* Look-Up Table *).

## Results and resources usage

The algorithm has been tested using the famous image "Lena". The hash is calculated using both the software and the hardware impementation. The image used as input is the following one (resized to a size of 32x32 pixels):

As shown in the image below, a 4.2 speed-up factor is achieved thanks to the use of the FPGA.

The hash value obtained is the same in both implementations (<i>0x999C14688FDF9335</i>).

Regarding the use of resources, we can appreciate the high rate of DSP units used. However, this design doesn't need many flip-flops or BRAM memories. With respect to the energy usage, this design has a power consumption of 2.242 W (almost the 70% represents the ARM consumption).
